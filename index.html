      <p><strong>Welcome!</strong></p>
      <p>CASOCO is a software company that makes software for everyone and evrything! We don't have much going on right now, exept ideas for a digital magazine are starting to pop up.</p>
      <p>CASOCO may look like a complex name, but it's very easy to pronounce! Just say Case-Oh-Co really fast, and you've got it!</p>
      <p>Even though we have less than 20 employees, we are not currently hiring. However, We would love support. Donations are coming soon, so stay tuned!</p>
      <p>In order to prevent competitors stealing employees, we will not publicly say the names of our workers in any division.</p>
